In some cases, it may be helpful to assist with one’s grammar, however it can become a microaggression when done in an effort to shame someone and insult their intelligence, experiences, and self-esteem. It is commonly seen on social media where one individual comments on someone’s grammar to make people view them as uneducated or to discredit the actual content behind a person's words. It reinforces perceptions linked to education, speech, and intelligence/qualification. It can make the person speaking feel ashamed and not confident to speak up anymore. This microaggression may be used to slight or belittle one’s speech, dialect, and ultimately uphold Western, English ways of speaking.",

Asking them to explain to you “all things transgender”, asking loads of questions, etc. is putting more burden on the individual to educate you, rather than you making an effort to educate yourself. It’s important for individuals to research issues themselves, and for them to take the initiative to learn before asking someone to do all the work on your learning. It also implies that there is a manual to understanding one’s identity, however people and experiences are unique, and what may apply to one individual may not apply to another.",

While it is helpful in many contexts to be positive and “see the bright side”, it ignores structural and systemic barriers, as well as bias and stereotypes, that negatively contribute to many people’s lives. Statements like “just be positive”, when said to an individual who has experienced discrimination, are akin to statements like “just get over it” and are forms of microinvalidations, which serve to invalidate and erase people’s experiences. This may lead the person to feel they are unable to talk about their feelings and experiences openly and stifle their ability to get the help and reassurance they may need. \n\nWhen said to someone living with a disability or someone living with mental health issues, for example, it can dismiss their feelings and lived realities, can harm their own personal perspective and intuition on their own mental health, and undermine their personal agency. Also, it may make someone feel like they are being pessimistic or negative, when they are really responding naturally and authentically. ",

First, these statements imply that one’s identity is something to be resilient of. They suggest that it is inherently difficult to have a particular identity, or that a particular identity is abnormal, and then praise an individual for their bravery and resilience in spite of their identity. Additionally, when said to individuals expressing experiences of discrimination, statements like these contribute to “toxic positivity” and sometimes implies that people may be able to overcome oppression if they are simply resilient. This statement also may compel people to explain their experience with oppression to meet a narrative that centres “resiliency” and “bravery”. \n",
